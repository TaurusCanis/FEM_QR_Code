## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was a good exercise for helping to reinforce the proper workflow. I tend to hack around and just do things as they come up, but working with a relatively simple assignment and having a straightforward process for how to approach it outlined was very helpful. I need to adopt that kind of process for my own projects. And I very much need to keep practicing with CSS and design. I've been using CSS for years but have never really felt like I was very good at it.


### Continued development

I definitely need to work on media queries. I struggle to decide where to put them.

### Useful resources

- [How to Center a Div](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/center-a-div/) - I feel like I always have to look up how to center divs. This resource has a bunch of different ways to do it.
